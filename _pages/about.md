# About me

**PhD in Biroengineering**

I am a PhD in Bioengineering at Stanford University,co-advised by [Prof. Michael Lin](https://linlab.stanford.edu/) and [Prof. Thomas Clandinin](https://flyvisionlab.weebly.com/), focusing on developing new methods for revealing neuronal dynamics across multiple scales, bridging the gap between cellular activity and broader neural circuits. I'm also part of the [Interdisciplinary Initiatives Program](https://biox.stanford.edu/research/seed-grants/interdisciplinary-initiatives-program-seed-grant-decoding-dendritic-computation). 

**MS in Mechanics**

From 2014 to 2018, I got my Bachelor's degree in Mechanics from Tsinghua University. This provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics and physics. I am eager for new challenges and embrace opportunities that will allow me to grow and excel in my field.

## Research Experience

      This research extend the applications of voltage imaging to the quantal response domain, including in human neurons, opening up the possibility of high-throughput, high-content characterization of neuronal dysfunction in disease.

## Ad-hoc 
- Co-organizer of [MBCT seminar series](https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/programs/community-building/seminar-series-wu-tsai-neuro/mind-brain-computation-and-technology-mbct-seminar-series) from 2022 to 2023.

- Designed [Litsurf](https://github.com/AlexYkHao/litsurf_backend), a web app that finds the most relevant content from a list of content sources for a user based on their profiles, allowing researchers to discover relevant publications they might otherwise miss using traditional keyword searches. Feel free to use it in my github repository.
